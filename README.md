# FarhadCoin

farhadCoin is a simple blockchain simulator built with TypeScript and Angular that allows you to interact with a blockchain. The purpose of the project was to learn how blockchains work by building one from scratch.

I developed a simple blockchain with methods to create and hash transactions, create and mine blocks, and validate every transaction on the chain. Users can view blocks on the chain, see transactions within blocks, create new transactions, mine blocks, and set the mining reward and difficulty.
